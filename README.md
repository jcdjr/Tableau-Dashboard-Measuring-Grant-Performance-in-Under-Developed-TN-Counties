# Measuring-Grant-Performance-in-Under-Developed-TN-Counties

**Background**

The primary goal of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (TNECD) is to incentivize business investment and expansion within state. Incentives and grants are used to attract investment to regions of the state that are underdeveloped.  

**Project Summary**

Using data from the TNECD, I created a dashboard in Tableau to measure the effectiveness of economic grants in Tennessee. Premiums, bonuses, and other incentives are awarded to businesses that invest and expand in under developed counties which are categorized in tiers 1-4 with 4 being the most underdeveloped.  

**Research Questions:**

Have tier-4 counties received more or less grants compared to the more developed tier-1 counties?

What type of projects receive the most grants? 

Is there a correlation between grant money and the number of jobs created in a county?

**Tools Used**

SQL, Excel, and Tableau
